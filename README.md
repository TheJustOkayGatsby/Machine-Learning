# Machine-Learning
This is a selection of exercises for Machine learning. Projects relating to classifiers and regressions, and the tuning thereof. It is important to note that the focus of this course was the **mathematical basis of models and methods, and understanding the workings thereof**. The focus of the next half, **data mining focused on implentation**.


Models used in this module:
1) **Naive Bayes**
2) **SVC**: Support Vector Classification
3) **SVM**: Support Vector Machine
4) **PCA**: Principal Component Analysis
5) Decision Trees, sort of
6) **Random Forest**
